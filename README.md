Analyze a Phishing Email Sample.

This task involves analyzing a suspicious email to identify common phishing characteristics. Using tools like an email client or saved email file and an online header analyzer, you will examine the sender's address, headers, links, attachments, and the email content itself for signs of deception. Key indicators include spoofed addresses, urgent or threatening language, mismatched or suspicious URLs, unexpected attachments, and spelling or grammar errors. The goal is to summarize all phishing traits found in the email in a concise report.
